	Code review
	TODO:
		Shield wire for enc
		Start testing

2/2/2020:
	Debugging and testing with hardware(again)
	Progress:
		The code now compiles properly, with some unexpected bugs fixed.
		Tested with current sensor, which functions.
		Tested with load sensor, the code functions. 
		However, the the load cell chip we use have 2 modes: Hi/Lo refresh ratei(80/10Hz). I(FJ) somehow changed the chip to Lo rate, making the reading very slow.  
	TODO:(Alot)
		Testing code with the encoder.
		Reverting the LC chip back to high refresh rate(hardware end)
		Testing the PID controller with the motors and sensors
